# HW-One

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to make it more accessible for future programmers who may need to work on the website.

Why it is useful:
The code for this website worked, but it was not good for long term sustainability and was difficult to read. This would make any additions or fixes that would need to be done in the future much more difficult and time consuming to apply.
